# Security Policy

This repository contains **draft ASCP specifications**, not production software. At this early stage, most feedback — including potential security concerns about the *design* of the protocol — **may be submitted publicly** via Issues or Discussions.

However, there are a few important distinctions:

## **For Specification Concerns**,

if your concern relates to:

* protocol design weaknesses,
* trust or identity model issues,
* envelope security assumptions (JWS/JWE),
* ALSP ordering or replay risks,
* governance / membership logic,
* metadata exposure or privacy considerations,

**you may open a public Issue or Discussion**, unless you believe the concern could:

* enable misuse of referenced standards or third‑party implementations,
* or otherwise introduce unnecessary risk if shared publicly.

If you believe the issue is sensitive or could have downstream impact:

**Please email us privately** at [**ascp@reframetech.com**](mailto:ascp@reframetech.com).

Use your judgment — when in doubt, send it privately.

## For Implementation Concerns,

If at any point this repository includes **source code**, or if you are reporting a vulnerability in an **implementation of ASCP** (whether by Reframe or another party):

🔒 **Always disclose privately.**

Email: **[ascp@reframetech.com](mailto:ascp@reframetech.com)**

This follows standard responsible disclosure practices.

## Scope

This policy applies to:

* The ASCP specification documents in this repo
* Early feedback on protocol security properties

It does **not** replace or supersede responsible disclosure norms for software vulnerabilities.

## Thank You

We appreciate your help in improving the security and resilience of ASCP as it evolves from draft specifications toward a formal open standard.
