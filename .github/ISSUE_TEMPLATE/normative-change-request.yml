        **Use this template to propose a modification to normative rules** within the ASCP specification suite.  
        Normative changes affect interoperability, compliance, required behaviors, cryptographic semantics, or any MUST/SHOULD-level requirement.

        Please discuss major changes in a GitHub Discussion first if possible.
