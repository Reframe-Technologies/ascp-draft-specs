# Contributing to ASCP (Agent Shared Cognition Protocol)

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the **Agent Shared Cognition Protocol (ASCP)**.  
ASCP is intended to become an **open, vendor-neutral Internet Standard** supporting the emerging **Cortex Layer**—a durable substrate for human–AI shared cognition.

This repository hosts **early, pre-IETF drafts** of the ASCP specifications and supporting documents. Contributions are welcome and strongly encouraged.

# 🧭 Guiding Principles

- **Open specification, not proprietary control**  
- **Interoperability above implementation preference**  
- **Clarity, precision, and testability**  
- **Alignment with IETF processes and norms**  
- **Human-centered collaboration (Cortex Layer design goals)**

# 📑 What You Can Contribute

You may contribute:

- Improvements to draft specification text  
- Corrections to grammar, terminology, or formatting  
- Proposed clarifications or refinements to semantics  
- Security considerations, threat models, and protocol hardening  
- ABNF grammar improvements  
- Examples or implementation guidance  
- Issues, discussions, and proposals  
- Early prototype implementations (Apache 2.0)  
- Experience reports or interoperability findings

# 🛠 Contribution Process

We use a **Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)** workflow.  
No separate CLA is required at this stage.

To contribute:

1. **Fork the repository**
2. **Create a feature branch**
3. Make your edits or additions
4. **Sign your commit** using the DCO format  
   (`git commit -s -m "…"` adds the required signature)
5. Submit a Pull Request
6. Participate in discussion and revision if needed

Every commit must contain the `Signed-off-by:` line that states you have the right to contribute the code/text under the project licenses.

# 🌐 Path Toward IETF Standardization

ASCP is explicitly being developed with the intention of:

- Producing **Internet-Drafts (I-Ds)**  
- Participating in a **Birds-of-a-Feather (BoF)** discussion  
- Moving toward a **Working Group (WG)**  
- Publishing **Standard-Track RFCs**

As such, contributions should align with IETF norms:

- Clear, technical, non-promotional writing  
- Protocol behaviors described as **MUST/SHOULD/MAY** (RFC 2119 / 8174)  
- Precise definitions and unambiguous semantics  
- Security and privacy considerations included early

---

# 💬 Discussions & Issues

We welcome:

- Technical clarifications  
- Architectural debate  
- Security analysis  
- Comparisons with related work  
- Interop questions  
- Early adopter feedback  

Please be respectful, constructive, and collaborative.
